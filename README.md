# Overlay Chart

Overlay Chart is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 by EarnForex.com. It lets you overlay a chart of another symbol on the chart of the current symbol. It works for any timeframe and you can scroll through the chart back and forward. A second price scale is placed for convenience.
